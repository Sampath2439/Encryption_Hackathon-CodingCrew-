Behavioral Analytics for Detecting Anomalies in Financial Transactions
Track: "Behavioral Analytics for Security"
Challenge: Implement and improve behavioral analytics solutions that can detect anomalies in financial transactions, providing enhanced security against fraudulent activities.

Dataset : For solving this problem we took a data set called "Synthetic Finantial Dataset" consists of 11 feratures. 

FRAUD DETECTION - Its classification model which classifies the data either anomaly or not anomaly.

Executive Summary : Develop algorithms to create user profiles based on historical transaction data.
                    Analyse patterns in user behaviour, including typical transaction amounts, spending habits, and geographic locations.
                    In addition to transaction data, include facial images captured during specific transactions or authentication events.
Deep Learning : Split the data in to training, validation and test datasets.
                Split the data in to training, validation and test datasets.
                Evaluate the model performance on validation set. Utilizing metrices such as accuracy, precision, recall anf F1 score to access classification performance.
